# NOTE

Those emoji are currently supported nowhere.

There are here for testing (manually parsed from webpage from the moment with conversion)

Page: http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-candidates.html

Command for trimming (replace with your PNG) : 

  convert U+101700.png -fuzz 10% -transparent white U+101700.png

I'll write a parser for it soon.
